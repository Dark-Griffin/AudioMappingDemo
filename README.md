# AudioMappingDemo
Dragon Ruby audio mapping with coordinates demo, by DarkGriffin.

Noise warning, running this demo will make noise with the only way to stop it being to move away from emitters or close the program.  Headphones recommended.

A demo app showing a method for adding audio points to a map, then playing the right stuff given a listener position and rotation on the map.

Useful for sound mixing when you have different points of view for the same level/scene/world, such as in Myst slideshow games where from different screens you can hear the same machines/scenery.
Uses demo sounds from Dragon Ruby.
